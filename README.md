# Fictional Retail AI Projects

This repository contains a collection of AI/ML projects designed to demonstrate strategic approaches to solving retail challenges.  
The projects focus on high-level solutions, workflows, and methodologies that can be applied in business contexts for learning and experimentation.

Each project includes sample input data to illustrate concepts and workflows.

## Projects Overview

### Product Recommendation System

**Objective:** Help customers discover products more effectively through recommendations.

**Approach:** Transform product information into numerical representations (embeddings) and use similarity-based search to find relevant recommendations.

**Learning Value:** Understand how AI can enhance customer experience and drive engagement.

---

### Customer Review Sentiment Analyzer

**Objective:** Automatically gauge customer sentiment from reviews to inform business decisions.

**Approach:** Classify reviews as positive or negative and quantify confidence in predictions.

**Learning Value:** Learn how sentiment analysis provides insights into product performance and customer satisfaction.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Demo

**Objective:** Provide accurate, context-aware answers to business questions using internal documents.

**Note:** This project includes sample documents for demonstration and learning purposes.

**Approach:** Combine document retrieval (semantic similarity) with language generation to answer questions using relevant context.

**Learning Value:** Understand how retrieval-augmented generation can streamline information access and support decision-making.

### AI-Powered Marketing Content Generator

**Objective:** Automatically generate creative and witty marketing content — product descriptions and ad copy — for products in a fictional retail company.

**Approach:** Use a free, instruction-tuned generative model with distinct prompt templates for different content types; provide an interactive Gradio demo for selecting products and generating content. Emphasize prompt engineering to control tone and marketing intent.

**Learning Value:** Explore prompt engineering, generative text for marketing, and the trade-offs between model size, speed, and creative output.
