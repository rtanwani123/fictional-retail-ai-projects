# AI-Powered Marketing Content Generator

**Objective:** Automatically generate creative and witty marketing content — including product descriptions and ad copy — for products in a fictional retail company.

**Note:** This project is fictional and intended for demonstration and learning purposes.

---

## Strategic Approach
- Use a free and secure generative AI model to produce creative marketing text for individual products.  
- Apply distinct prompt templates for **Product Description** and **Ad Copy** so each content type serves a different communication goal (informative vs. persuasive).  
- Provide an interactive Gradio interface to let users select products and content types and evaluate outputs.  
- Emphasize **prompt engineering** as the primary control mechanism: carefully crafted prompts direct tone, structure, length, and marketing intent.

## Learning Value
- Learn how **prompt design** influences the behavior, tone, and reliability of generative models.  
- See practical ways Generative AI can accelerate marketing tasks like product storytelling and ad copy generation.  
- Explore trade-offs between model size, inference speed, and output quality when using free/open models.  
- Gain experience building an interactive demo that non-technical stakeholders can use to evaluate AI-produced marketing content.

This project demonstrates how well-structured prompts and lightweight, free models can be combined to support marketing workflows in a safe, repeatable manner.
