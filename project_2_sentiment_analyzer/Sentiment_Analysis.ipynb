        "# ============================================================\n",
        "# This project builds a Customer Review Sentiment Analyzer\n",
        "# for Fictional Retail Co. using only free and open-source tools.\n",
        "#\n",
        "# The goal is to automatically understand whether a customer’s\n",
        "# review is positive or negative using natural language models.\n",
        "#\n",
        "# Example:\n",
        "# Fictional Retail Co. receives many online reviews like:\n",
        "#   - “The delivery was fast and the shoes are super comfy!”\n",
        "#   - “Customer service was rude and didn’t help with my return.”\n",
        "#\n",
        "# Our system reads these reviews and classifies them as:\n",
        "#   → Positive\n",
        "#   → Negative\n",
        "#\n",
        "# It also measures confidence, showing how sure the model is\n",
        "# about its prediction.\n",
        "#\n",
        "# ============================================================\n",
        "# SIMPLE EXPLANATION OF EACH STEP\n",
        "# ============================================================\n",
        "#\n",
        "# Step 1 — Install the Tools\n",
        "# We start by installing Python packages (libraries) that help\n",
        "# us with language understanding and visualization:\n",
        "#   - Transformers → to use a free Hugging Face sentiment model\n",
        "#   - Torch → supports the model computations\n",
        "#   - Pandas → to handle CSV data files (like spreadsheets)\n",
        "#   - Matplotlib & Seaborn → to create simple visual charts\n",
        "#   - Gradio → to make an interactive demo where you can test reviews\n",
        "#\n",
        "# Think of this step as setting up your “AI lab” before starting experiments.\n",
        "#\n",
        "# Step 2 — Load the Data\n",
        "# We load a CSV file from the folder `/content/fictional_retail_docs`.\n",
        "# The file (`fictional_retail_reviews.csv`) contains columns like:\n",
        "#   - customer_id\n",
        "#   - product_name\n",
        "#   - review_text\n",
        "#\n",
        "# These are synthetic (fake) reviews for learning and demonstration only.\n",
        "# If the file isn’t found, we show a clear error message to remind the user\n",
        "# to upload it before running the notebook.\n",
        "#\n",
        "# Step 3 — Initialize the Free Sentiment Model\n",
        "# We use the free Hugging Face model:\n",
        "#   distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english\n",
        "#\n",
        "# This model is lightweight and perfect for detecting whether a sentence\n",
        "# expresses positive or negative emotion.\n",
        "#\n",
        "# You can think of it like a robot that reads each review and says:\n",
        "#   “This sounds happy” or “This sounds upset.”\n",
        "#\n",
        "# Step 4 — Analyze Each Review\n",
        "# We define a helper function called get_sentiment(text):\n",
        "#   - It passes the review text to the model\n",
        "#   - The model returns a label (POSITIVE / NEGATIVE)\n",
        "#   - We also store the confidence score (0 to 1)\n",
        "#\n",
        "# We apply this function to all reviews in our dataset using Pandas.\n",
        "# The result is two new columns:\n",
        "#   → sentiment\n",
        "#   → confidence\n",
        "#\n",
        "# Step 5 — Create a Simple Dashboard\n",
        "# Now that each review has a sentiment, we visualize the results:\n",
        "#   - Plot 1 → Overall Sentiment Distribution\n",
        "#       Shows how many reviews are positive or negative overall.\n",
        "#   - Plot 2 → Sentiment by Product\n",
        "#       Compares positivity across different products.\n",
        "#\n",
        "# This gives a quick snapshot of what customers like or dislike.\n",
        "#\n",
        "# Step 6 — Build an Interactive Gradio Demo (Optional)\n",
        "# To make the project more fun and user-friendly, we build a tiny web app\n",
        "# using Gradio.\n",
        "#\n",
        "# You can type a review (for example, “The quality is great but delivery was late”)\n",
        "# and get instant feedback like:\n",
        "#   → Sentiment: Negative\n",
        "#   → Confidence: 0.82\n",
        "#\n",
        "# This makes it perfect for presentations, teaching, or even\n",
        "# for a basic proof-of-concept in a real business.\n",
