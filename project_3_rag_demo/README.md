# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Demo

Objective: Provide accurate, context-aware answers to business questions using internal documents.

Note: This project includes sample documents for demonstration and learning purposes.

---

## Strategic Approach
- Retrieve relevant information from documents using semantic similarity.  
- Generate coherent answers by combining retrieved context with language generation models.  
- Ensure responses are context-aware rather than relying on raw search results.

---

## Learning Value
- Understand how retrieval-augmented generation can streamline information access.  
- Explore the combination of document retrieval and AI-driven summarization.  
- See how AI can support decision-making and operational efficiency.

This project demonstrates a framework for building intelligent systems that improve access to organizational knowledge.
